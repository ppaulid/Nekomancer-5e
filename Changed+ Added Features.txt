Charmer Clan:
New Level 3 Feature: "Illusory Reflexes"
Feature Name: Illusory Reflexes
Description:
Starting at 3rd level, when you channel your Neko form, your connection to illusion magic enhances your agility and misdirection in combat. While Neko Channeling, you gain the following benefits:

Blurred Form: Attackers have disadvantage on the first melee or ranged attack against you each turn.
Mystifying Strikes: Your spectral tail strikes leave an illusory afterimage. If you hit with a tail attack, you can impose disadvantage on the target's next attack roll until the start of your next turn.
Feature Benefits Summary
Blurred Form (Reaction): Represents your agility and use of illusions, making it harder for enemies to hit you. Similar to the Blur spell but limited to once per turn.
Mystifying Strikes: Adds a combat utility element to your tail attacks, emphasizing the Charmer Clan's deceptive nature in battle.
